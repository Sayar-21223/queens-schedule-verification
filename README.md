## Overview

This is meant to be a onestop shop for CS students at Queen's navigating course selection. I'm building an informed, context dependent chatbot that answers any of their questions relating to course selection (and trolls them if they get off topic). Frosh can also upload a photo of their schedule, and I will analyze it to see if there are any mistakes or missing courses in it.

## Getting Started (Local Development)

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.10+
- Node.js 18+
- Google Cloud Service Account JSON key
- OpenAI API key

### Backend

```bash
cd backend
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Set environment variable for Google credentials (local)
export GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS="path/to/key.json"

# Or use .env and python-dotenv if applicable
python app.py
```


### Frontend

```bash
cd frontend
npm install
npm run dev
```

---

## Deployment

- **Render Web Service (backend)**: uses Gunicorn and auto-builds with requirements.txt and Procfile
- **Netlify or Render Static Site (frontend)**: deploys from `dist/` after `npm run build`

---

## Use Case

This application was built to support incoming Queenâ€™s University students in verifying their academic schedules. By combining OCR, LLM-based parsing, and domain-specific logic, it ensures students have clear and accurate access to their course information.
